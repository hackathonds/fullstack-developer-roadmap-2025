# Full Stack Developer Roadmap 2025

This repository is a complete, structured learning path designed for a professional .NET developer transitioning into a modern full stack developer role (React + TypeScript + Azure + DevOps). It contains an 8-phase roadmap, project specs, certification guides, curated resources, issue templates and CI examples.

Quick start:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Follow ROADMAP.md to begin Phase 1.
3. Use the Issue templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE to track progress.
4. Use the Projects board (Kanban) to manage tasks per phase.

Repository layout:
- README.md — this file
- ROADMAP.md — week-by-week learning plan
- PROJECTS.md — 12+ projects with specs and acceptance criteria
- CERTIFICATIONS.md — study plans for AZ-900, AZ-204, Meta front-end, etc.
- RESOURCES.md — curated links for each technology
- phase-1-fundamentals/ ... phase-8-portfolio-production/ — per-phase content & starters
- templates/ — PR and issue templates
- .github/ — workflows and issue templates

How to use:
- Create an issue per week or milestone using the templates.
- Move issues across the GitHub Projects board stages: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done.
- Add progress logs inside each phase folder as you complete lessons and projects.

Good luck — progress consistently and build projects as you learn.
